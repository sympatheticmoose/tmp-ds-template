## How Grafana Labs use this board

We ‚ù§ the feedback we receive from our users and those starting to explore whether Grafana can help them, to inform what we prioritise to build next. We also have a wonderful community and [development tools](https://grafana.com/developers) to help the creation of new data sources.

We combine the insights we gain from our community here and our customers to inform our plans.

With the [Plugin Catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/) our [policy](https://grafana.com/legal/plugins) aims to reduce duplication in favour of fewer, higher quality data sources which reduce the burden on users when picking which makes sense for them. By sharing our future plans for new data sources, whether open source, commercial or enterprise, we hope to avoid people building data sources which would then be rejected within the plugin review process. As with all roadmaps, our plans are subject to change, but through this public project we aim for transparency and to provide users of Grafana a view of our current intent.

## Additional details

### No pipeline
When a new data source request is raised it is automatically added to this board. We aim to review requests within 7 days to assign to the most appropriate pipeline given the information at our disposal at the time.

### Community
Data sources we would love to have in our catalog, but Grafana Labs and our commercial partners have no plans to build them. We hope by centralising the idea and the need within this board, it helps our community to come together to build impactful new plugins.

### Grafana OSS
Data source requests which Grafana Labs has accepted and are actively planning to build. Typically these will be shorter timelines of roughly the next two quarters. 

### Grafana Enterprise
Data source requests which we are actively considering, and which are most likely to be delivered as an Enterprise plugin (which are also available in our Grafana Cloud free forever tier). These requests can represent a longer timeframe and we try to indicate which are `Next` in our pipeline and which are still under consideration - where we gather more insights on their relative priority, understand our feasibility to deliver, and make decisions on whether it would make more sense to deliver in open source.

Grafana Labs remain committed to open source and endeavour to deliver the vast majority of our code as open source. Enterprise plugin licenses help us continue as a sustainable business and provide these services, and are included even in our Grafana Cloud free tier

### Commercial
Data sources which integrate with a commercial service and may actively compete with Grafana Labs as a company. We welcome these within our Big Tent, but require a partnership agreement to be in place. When a commercial vendor is actively building a plugin, this is indicated in the status and is a great opportunity to share your requirements and provide early feedback.
